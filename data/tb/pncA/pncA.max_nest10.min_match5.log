09/01/2018 11:54:35 Divide sequences into subgroups and define prg for each subgroup.
09/01/2018 11:54:35 Get kmeans partition of interval [238, 266]
09/01/2018 11:54:35 Add classes corresponding to 0 small sequences
09/01/2018 11:54:35 Now add classes corresponding to 90 longer sequences
09/01/2018 11:54:35 Transform sequences into kmer occurrence vectors
09/01/2018 11:54:35 These vectors have length 2250
09/01/2018 11:54:35 Now cluster:
